# A* Pathfinding Visualization
This project visualizes the A* pathfinding algorithm on a grid. Users can set a start point, end point, and obstacles, then see the A* algorithm find the shortest path.

## Features

Visual representation of the A* pathfinding algorithm

Set start and end points

Add and remove obstacles

Dynamic pathfinding visualization

# Usage
